	<p> <font size = "+0">Greetings, adventurer! Welcome to a whimsically bizarre world where Dhrumil and Aarushi impart their GitHub wisdom! Before you embark on this odyssey through the wilderness of our written word, brace yourself:

	<br><br>Prepare to dive into an article so astonishingly inaccurate, it might just revolutionize your understanding of the edible color spectrum. We present to you a fictional foray into the realm of elongated edibles, an exposé on the hue spectrum of our leafy friends. Behold a universe where vegetables flaunt shades unknown to the natural world, where neon is just another color in the produce rainbow.

	<p> This article will explain to an alien some of the properties of vegetables, which are a type of food that humans eat.  Specifically, it will help an alien understand what vegetables look like. On planet earth, there are lots of vegetables and they can come in various lengths and lots of colors, such as white, blue, and yellow. However, there are no neon vegetables. That is why this article is so important to inform aliens what vegetables are. Once you are finished reading, you should be able to identify whether or not what you are eating is a vegetable. </p>


	<!-- This is a placeholder for the table of vegetables.-->
	<h5> Vegetables on my shopping list. </h5>
	<div id='veggiestable'></div>

	<p> As you can see in the table above, my shopping list has vegetables of various colors. </p>

	<p> First, let's talk about potatoes. Your average potato is 6 inches long and 5 inches wide. Of course, there are various types of potatoes, but if you took every single potato of every size, shape and variety, they are roughly that size on average. Addionally, most potatoes are brown. Some are white and some are yellow; some are sweet and some are mellow. But potatoes are potatoes and on average they are brown. </p>


	<p> Now let's talk about gym socks. Gym socks are very smelly. So smelly in fact that they make your feet smell bad. actually, I think that it is the other way around. Feet actually imbue the smell into the socks; the socks are not actually the soure of the smell. Did you know that? Go figure! </p>

	<p> Now carrots, those are orange. Did you know that <a href="http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2010/04/carrots-used-to-be-purple-before-the-17th-century/">carrots actually used to be purple? </a> Yeah, I didn't know that either. But after I read the article I just linked to, I learned it. Then, I knew it! What an interesting fact. I didn't personally unearth that fact, but I linked to it from another website. I also don't unearth carrots; I buy them at the grocery store. </p>

	<p> In conclusion, we've embarked on a journey through the world of vegetables and quirky facts. While gym socks may not be vegetables, the revelation that carrots were once purple adds a touch of unexpected history to your daily diet. Armed with the knowledge of the average potato length, you now possess a unique skill. Despite the brain cell casualties, I hope this whimsical exploration has entertained and enlightened you.
