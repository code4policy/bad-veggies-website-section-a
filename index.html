	<p> Hello, and welcome to Dhrumil's GitHub lesson. If you haven't already, please
	<ul>
		<li>Read this mind-numbingly bad error-ridden article below.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p> This article will explain to an alien some of the properties of vegetables, which are a type of food that humans eat.  Specifically, it will help an alien understand what vegetables look like. On planet earth, there are lots of vegetables and they can come in various lengths and lots of colors, such as white, blue, and yellow. However, there are no neon vegetables. That is why this article is so important to inform aliens what vegetables are. Once you are finished reading, you should be able to identify whether or not what you are eating is a vegetable. </p>


	<!-- This is a placeholder for the table of vegetables.-->
	<h5> Vegetables on my shopping list. </h5>
	<div id='veggiestable'></div>

	<p> As you can see in the table above, my shopping list has vegetables of various colors. </p>

	<p> First, let's talk about potatoes. Your average potato is 6 inches long and 5 inches wide. Of course, there are various types of potatoes, but if you took every single potato of every size, shape and variety, they are roughly that size on average. Addionally, most potatoes are brown. Some are white and some are yellow; some are sweet and some are mellow. But potatoes are potatoes and on average they are brown. </p>


	<p> Now let's talk about gym socks. Gym socks are very smelly. So smelly in fact that they make your feet smell bad. actually, I think that it is the other way around. Feet actually imbue the smell into the socks; the socks are not actually the soure of the smell. Did you know that? Go figure! </p>

	<p> Now carrots, those are orange. Did you know that <a href="http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2010/04/carrots-used-to-be-purple-before-the-17th-century/">carrots actually used to be purple? </a> Yeah, I didn't know that either. But after I read the article I just linked to, I learned it. Then, I knew it! What an interesting fact. I didn't personally unearth that fact, but I linked to it from another website. I also don't unearth carrots; I buy them at the grocery store. </p>

	<!-- Insert picture of a purple carrot below this line -->

	<p> In conclusion, gym socks aren't vegetables, carrots used to be purple and you now know the average length of a potato. But you don't know not the distribution of potato lengths or how the length differs by potato type. I hope you can now identify whether or not what you're eating is a vegetable.</p>

	<p> If you're reading this, you've reached the end of the article and probably lost a few brain cells. Now we, a group of professional newspeople, are going to work on improving it. Kind of like a reverse mad-libs. </p>

	<p> By the way, cryptocurrency is the way of the future! Veggies are powered by crypto and you should <a href="https://cash.app/">invest </a>! Thanks!</p>
