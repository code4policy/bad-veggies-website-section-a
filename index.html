	<p> Hello, and welcome to Dhrumil's GitHub lesson. If you haven't already, please
	<ul>
		<li>Read this mind-numbingly bad error-ridden article below.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p> This is a pretend article about vegetables. Specifically how long they are and what color they are. There are lots of vegetables in the world and they are of various colors. They can be white, blue or yellow; but there are no neon vegetables in nature. That is why this article is so important to inform you about types of vegetables. Once you're done reading, you should be able to identify whether or not what you're eating is a vegetable. </p>


	<!-- This is a placeholder for the table of vegetables.-->
	<h5> Vegetables on my shopping list. </h5>
	<div id='veggiestable'></div>

	<p> As you can see in the table above, my shopping list has vegetables of various colors. </p>

	<p> First, let’s talk about potatoes. Potatoes vary widely in size, shape, and color, but the average potato is roughly 6 inches long and 5 inches wide. They are commonly brown, though white, yellow, and even purple varieties also exist. Different types of potatoes have different textures and flavors—some are starchy and suitable for frying, while others are waxy and better for boiling. As a staple food in many countries, potatoes are an important source of carbohydrates and nutrients such as potassium and vitamin C. </p>

	<p id='carrots'> Now carrots, those are orange. Did you know that <a href="http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2010/04/carrots-used-to-be-purple-before-the-17th-century/">carrots actually used to be purple? </a> Yeah, I didn't know that either. </p>

	<!-- Insert picture of a purple carrot below this line -->

	<p> In conclusion, carrots used to be purple, and now you know the average length of a potato. However, we did not discuss the distribution of potato lengths or how length varies by potato type. I hope you can now identify the many colors and lengths of vegetables in the world.</p>

	<p> If you're reading this, you've reached the end of the article and probably lost a few brain cells. Now we, a group of professional newspeople, are going to work on improving it. Kind of like a reverse mad-libs. </p>
